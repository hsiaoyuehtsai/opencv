# OpenCV Python Projects

This repository contains several Python scripts using OpenCV to demonstrate various image processing techniques. Below is a brief description of each file:

## Scripts

### 1. `basic.py`
- Introduction to basic image processing functions like loading, displaying, and saving images using OpenCV.

### 2. `bitwise.py`
- Demonstrates bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT on binary images.

### 3. `contours.py`
- Detects and draws contours in an image, showcasing how to use OpenCV's contour detection functions.

### 4. `draw.py`
- Shows how to draw shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) and add text on images using OpenCV.

### 5. `face_detect.py`
- Uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images or videos.

### 6. `face_recognition.py`
- Implements a face recognition system using OpenCV by comparing features of faces with a pre-trained model.

### 7. `face_train.py`
- Trains a face recognition model using images and saves the model for future use.

### 8. `face_trained.yml`
- The trained model data saved in YML format used for face recognition.

### 9. `features.npy`
- Numpy array storing the features extracted from the training dataset used in face recognition.

### 10. `gradients.py`
- Visualizes image gradients using Sobel and Laplacian filters for edge detection.

### 11. `haar_face.xml`
- The XML file for Haar Cascade classifier used for face detection.

### 12. `histogram.py`
- Computes and plots histograms for grayscale and color images, explaining image intensity distribution.

### 13. `labels.npy`
- Numpy array storing labels corresponding to the images in the training dataset for face recognition.

### 14. `masking.py`
- Applies masks to images, demonstrating selective region-based processing.

### 15. `practice.py`
- A script for experimenting with various OpenCV functions and techniques.

### 16. `smoothing.py`
- Implements image smoothing techniques such as blurring, Gaussian blur, and median blur.

### 17. `spaces.py`
- Converts images between different color spaces (BGR, RGB, HSV, etc.) and explains their importance.

### 18. `splitmerge.py`
- Splits an image into its color channels and merges them back, showcasing channel manipulation.

### 19. `thresh.py`
- Applies thresholding techniques like binary thresholding, adaptive thresholding, and Otsu's method.

### 20. `transformations.py`
- Demonstrates various image transformations like translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective warping.

## Additional Files

### 21. `face_trained.yml`
- Contains the trained face recognition model data.

### 22. `features.npy`
- Stores the features extracted during face recognition training.

### 23. `labels.npy`
- Stores the labels used during face recognition training.

### 24. `haar_face.xml`
- Haar Cascade file used for face detection.
